## --- Part Two ---

The Elves start bringing their spoiled inventory to the trash chute.

To avoid future confusion, they now want to know **all ingredient IDs covered by the fresh ranges**, regardless of what ingredients they currently have on hand.

The second section of the database (the available IDs) is now irrelevant.

Given the ranges from the example:

```
3-5
10-14
16-20
12-18
```

The IDs these ranges consider fresh are:

`3, 4, 5, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20`

This totals **14** fresh ingredient IDs.

Process the database file again.  

**How many ingredient IDs are considered fresh according to the fresh ingredient ID ranges?**
